                    <h4>Uber Interview Experience 2021 (Business Analyst / Full Time)</h4>
                    <p>There were 3 rounds, the first one online test and the next two technical-cum-hr rounds. The online test was basic to intermediate in the challenge level (I prefer to say challenge and not difficulty) and questions were mainly focused on excel (intermediate), python ( basic to intermediate) and SQL (basic). The interviewers were very friendly and one of them was from our NITDGP itself. The first interview was focused on SQL queries, pivot tables, application of excel formulas, basic excel charts, very basic python and pandas. Yes, one needs pandas library knowledge for this job role. Finally, there was a simple business case study question, which factors or metrics will you look at to understand how good is a driver(in Uber)? In the next round topics were the same yet the challenge level was up! There were some business case study questions as well e.g. you have requested for a ride and there are five drivers in the vicinity, what factors will you look at to determine which driver is given priority? Finally some HR questions like what interests me in this job role etc. It was a very positive experience all over and the interviewers were very nice and understood the concerns of a fresher!! Have a nice day.</p>

                    <h4>Samsung R&D Interview Experience 2021 (Research Intern / Internship)</h4>
                    <p>Round 1(Coding Round): This round had 3 coding problems based on data structures and algorithms which had to be solved in 75 minutes:

                        1) Given an integer remove all the digits at even places and print the resulting integer.
                        
                        2) Given root nodes of two binary search trees(BST), print the common nodes of the two BSTs.
                        
                        3) This was a graph problem based on maximum matching in bipartite graphs. https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/maximum-bipartite-matching/1
                        
                        Three candidates were shortlisted for the second round.
                        
                        Round 2(Interview Round: Technical + HR): This round went on for about an hour. The interviewer introduced himself and then he asked me to give a brief introduction about myself.
                        
                        He began by asking me about the project I had mentioned in my resume. He asked questions like how the project would be useful to a user, what are the technologies used, what design pattern I followed, what challenges I faced, what drawbacks the projects had and how I plan to fix/implement them.
                        
                        He then asked few questions about Object Oriented Programming. Since I had mentioned both Java and C++ in my resume, he asked me to choose which one I was more comfortable with, I chose C++. He asked about operator overloading and friend function and its uses.
                        
                        He then asked about various sorting algorithms, their time complexities, which ones could be used effectively on linked list. I was not asked to code it.
                        
                        He then asked about pointers and dynamic memory allocation for 2D arrays.
                        
                        Lastly he asked what i was expecting from this internship and talked about the work culture, etc at the company.</p>

                        Natwest Interview Experience 2021 (Software Engineer / Full Time)</h4>
                    <p>Hello everyone, so Natwest visited our campus, and there were 2 rounds in total.

                        Online Assessment Round:
                        
                        3 coding questions, 30 Aptitude MCQs, and 20 technical MCQs were given. All three coding questions were of easy-medium level and were from array and queue, and the aptitude questions were also very easy, the technical MCQs were mostly from DBMS and a few were from OS.
                        
                        Technical Interview Round:
                        
                        Around 36 students were shortlisted for this round. The interview lasted for around 30-40 min for each student. They were mostly asking about the projects mentioned in the resume and a DSA question or if you say DBMS as your favorite subject then they might ask you to write some SQL Queries. For me, they started with very general questions, and then he moved on to the projects where he actually opened my GitHub profile and was asking questions on my project and my contribution to each project, this went on for like 20 minutes. Then he moved on and asked me my three favorite subjects where I said DSA and others so he asked me a question on DSA which was to sort a Linked List, he asked me to write the code on my compiler and then explain it. And then after that another Interviewer who was also present asked me some basic HR questions like: Where do you see yourselves in 3 years, any plan for higher studies, why should we hire you, etc. And then they finally asked me to ask any question I had. I asked them 2 questions and that's it.
                        
                        Tips: I would suggest being thorough with your resume, it's very important that you have a back for every line of your resume. And if you are given a question to code then take a few minutes and then start coding even if you know the answer, and always think loudly and keep explaining your code while writing it. And also have 2-3 questions prepared beforehand which you can ask them at the end.
                        
                        All the Best!</p>

                    <p>Round 1 (Coding Assessment)
                        The first coding round was held on codility where two questions were given and a timeframe of 70 mins was allocated.
                        
                        Questions :-
                        
                        Q: Given an array, find the length of the largest subset such that AND (&) of all its elements is greater than 0.
                        
                        Q: Minimum Deletion Cost to Avoid Repeating Letters at adjacent positions.
                        
                        After the coding round, around 45+ students were shortlisted for the technical interviews.
                        
                        Round 2 (Technical)
                        After introductions were done from both sides the interviewer proceeded to ask the following coding questions -
                        
                        Q1 (Balanced Paranthesis Problem) Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.
                        
                        He later added a twist to the problem where instead of the typical 3 types of brackets, there were 100 different types of different opening-closing pairs to which I gave a map-based approach and he was satisfied with it.
                        
                        Q2 Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [start(i), end(i)], merge all overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input. Link
                        
                        Round 3 (Technical)
                        This round started with 2 coding questions both based on linked list.
                        
                        Q1 Find the Intersection Point of two Linked Lists Link
                        
                        Q2 In a given linked list delete all the nodes' positions that are provided in the input array.
                        
                        After discussing a few of the edge cases he also made me run my code on some test cases.
                        
                        He then proceeded to ask me theory questions from CS fundamentals with a major focus on Operating Systems and OOP's. Difference between Process and Threads followed by a thorough discussion on Paging and its techniques, thrashing, Zombie Process, and also a brief talk on the concept of Virtual Memory.
                        
                        He also asked me a few brief questions about my technical projects.
                        
                        Round 4 (Technical + HR)
                        This round again began with a coding question :
                        
                        Q. Given that I have millions of server logs, I had to write a program to classify and store the information and print the 10 most occurring log messages.
                        
                        I suggested a map-based approach and he asked me to write the code. We also discussed a heap-based approach, both min and max heap.
                        
                        He was very interested in my Deep learning and then went ahead to ask me questions about it. He also asked me to solve some real-world problems related to it.
                        
                        Some questions on my Web-Dev Projects and the tech-stack (MEAN) I had used, with some questions related to it. Ex. Callback Hell and how to avoid it, Why is Node.Js Single-threaded.
                        
                        Towards the end of the interview, 2 HR based questions were posed -
                        
                        Q If I and another person were to be working on a project and the project gets delayed due to the other person and the manager blames you and your teammate equally, what would you do?
                        
                        Q If there were two projects one which is very interesting but isn't that impactful for the team and the other which is very impactful for the team but doesn't align with my interests, which one would I pick, and what would be the reason behind it.</p>

                    <h4>VERIZON Interview Experience 2021 (SDE / Full Time)</h4>
                    <p>so,initially we had resume shortlisting(may be based on cgpa)for the online test. we had our test on AMCAT platform for a duration of 1:30hr-2hrs.There were some english comprehension (22 questions in 18 min) logical ability (14 qstns in 14 min) quantitatuve ability(16 qstns 16min)and 2 coding questions which were of easy level(60min). a total of 52 students got shortlisted for the interviews

                        ROUND 1(TECHNICAL 45 min):A senior manager of verizon took the interview for me.Firstly she asked me to introduce myself and after that she asked me questions on python.what are different data types and data structures in python and detailed explanation about all of them.what is boolean where do we use it?and asked me if I knew about AI and ML..as i was not very much familiar with them i told her the same ,and said that I was willing to learn them.After that she shared her screen and showed me a recursive code and asked me to find the output and some discussion about my projects ..then she started asking me some questions on probability.. like there are 3 people and there were red and blue coloured hats..each of the persons are given one hat but the person wearing it could not see the colour of his own hat..he can see the colours of the hats others were wearing..now they have to play a game such that they win everytime(rules:they shouldn't discuss with each other,if they want to guess the colour of their hat they have to definitely guess the colour right,or he could pass..but in a guessing game all the 3 persons shouldn't pass in a row..if its 2 passes and 1 crt guess then also its a win.)so she asked me to find a strategy so that the chances of the win are maximum.Then she asked me the equation of a straight line and she asked what would be the effect on intercepts if we multiply the slope by k , add k to the slope,add k to 'x'.After that she asked me my fav subjects..i told her DSA and oops were my fav.she asked what data structures were...types and examples(detailed).4 pillars of oops(real life examples and details).which data structure is used for recursion?and finally she asked me if I had any questions for her.
                        
                        around 20 students got a call for HR round
                        
                        ROUND 2(HR): This round lasted for 15min.The HR was very friendly.she gave me an intro of herself and asked me to introduce myself hobbies,short term goals,longterm goals,goal in life..asked me about my projects ?what according to you is bad attitude and good attitude in a workspace?..How to deal with narrow minded people who work with women and LGBTQ communities?any questions for me?
                        
                        Most of the people who got the HR call were selected. TIPS:be very confident with your answers..if you dont know an answer tell the interviewer the same..and tell them that you are willing to learn the topic :)</p>

                    <h4>Oracle Interview Experience 2021 (Member of Technical Staff / Full Time)3</h4>
                    <p>Round 1: The first round was an online assessment on Oracle's own platform. The test lasted around 107 minutes and each section was allotted fixed time. It included various sections such as:

                        Verbal Ability and Comprehension Math and Logical Reasoning MCQs on CS Fundamentals MCQs on Data Structures and Algorithms Software Engineering Aptitude (included questions regarding conversion of written information to logical flow chart structure)
                        
                        Round 2: Technical Interview My interview started with brief introduction from both ends and then we discussed about my internships and projects. I was asked questions about the tech stacks I used. I was asked to code a medium level question(https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/sorting-elements-of-an-array-by-frequency-1587115621/1) on geeksforgeeks platform and screen was being shared. You have to constantly keep discussing your thoughts with the interviewer. He asked question like what is a vector or a hashmap and why is it being used here? I solved the question and it took around 45 minutes. The interviewer was friendly. I ended the round by asking questions like from when he is working in the company, how is his experience so far, technologies being used, etc.
                        
                        Round 3: Technical Interview This time I had to write the complete code on an ide. 1. Printing fibonacci series in reverse 2. Question on recursion
                        
                        Round 4: HR Round cum Technical Asked to code on notepad 1. Sorting by frequency 2. If the next number can only be -1 or +1 of the current number, then when will the number occur next. The interviewer helped me get to the solution by giving hints.
                        
                        Tips:
                        
                        A strong and well-written resume goes a long way in setting the first impression. You should have a thorough knowledge of everything that you mention on your resume; any item on it is fair game for the interviewer to examine.
                        
                        The interviewers are extremely friendly in most cases and will lead you on if you are stuck. Think out loud and discuss your approach with them instead of going into code directly. Asking the right questions will often simplify the problems for you. Stay confident, they do not expect you to know everything!</p>

                        As the next steps, I was expected to share my Resume. An Adobe talent partner reviews the applications holistically, after which if one gets shortlisted, is invited to a virtual interview.

                        I was asked about Polymorphism, Abstraction, Interface in detail. I was also asked some questions related to Operating Systems like explaining the concept of Paging and Scheduling Algorithms. I was also asked to differentiate between Arrays & Linked List and their application in real world.
                        
                        Moving towards the Programming Part, I was expected to share my screen and code on my preferred IDE. First problem was related to modified binary search and the second one was from modified DFS.
                        
                        Before ending the interview, the interviewer asked me if I wanted to ask any questions to him and then he signed off wishing me luck.
                        
                        Tips: The interview was resume oriented so make sure that you know everything about your resume.</p>

While answering behavioural questions, always try to map your actions to amazon's leadership principles. Then you'll have a higher chance of getting selected.
                        
                        Also be as much interactive as possible. Always ask questions during interviews and clear your doubts before proceeding with the solution.
